## About
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a widespread health issue with a significant impact
on global public health. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a pivotal role in managing
CKD and preventing its progression. This research focuses on enhancing the diagnostic
capabilities for CKD through the implementation of efficient machine learning-based
classification algorithms Our study leverages a diverse dataset comprising clinical,
demographic, and laboratory parameters of CKD patients. We employ state-of-the-art
machine learning techniques to develop robust classification models capable of
accurately identifying and classifying CKD stages. The algorithms utilized include but
are not limited to Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
To ensure the reliability and generalizability of the models, we adopt rigorous
validation techniques and cross-validation procedures. Performance metrics such as
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC-ROC) are employed to assess the effectiveness of the developed algorithms.
The research not only aims to enhance the accuracy of CKD diagnosis but also
emphasizes the importance of interpretability and transparency in machine learning
models for clinical applications.
